# Singly Linked List
Created a singly linked list that successfully passess all tests that have been created to ensure it behaves properly.

## Challenge
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

## Approach & Efficiency
Created a singly linked list,
Big O:
Time complexitiy: O(n)
Space complexity:O(n)

## API
add - adds values to list
traverse - allows seeing whats in the list
insert - adds new node
includes - adds values to new node
toString - turns data into a string
append - appends new node ot head
insertBefore - adds a node before current position
insertAfter - adds a node after current position
