The step through for this merge sort algorithm goes as follows,

the first step is we declare the mergessort function that takes in an array.

then we declare the variable n in which equals the array and its length,

we delcare the middle variable which will be the math floor function that rounds down and make it divisble by 2 to make sure there is a mid point regardless of the length of the array outside of it being empty.

we split the array into two parts a left and right side,

we then sort the elements from each side

once we finish sorting each side we merge them back into one array again.

once we merge the array we use a while loop with an if and else statments to murge the final array

after we merge it we call the function, then console log it to check the results.
